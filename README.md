HTTTP client based on `[axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)` to easily fetch SharePoint API. It is the ideal package to include in your [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/) project, not integrated to **Angular** though.

## Installation

You can add the package to your project by running the respective command line of your favorite package manager:

```bash
# Using NPM:
$ npm install -P axios xom-sharepoint

# Using Yarn:
$ yarn add axios xom-sharepoint
```

Or, if you are not in a Node enviroment, you can use the bundled files in `dist/` folder or incorporate the CDN in your HTML file (with *axios* embeded):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/xom-sharepoint@0.4.0/dist/xom-sharepoint.min.js"></script>
```
